#### Systematic program design  
* problem analysis -> data definitions

#### Standard ML 
  + functional programming

  + sml-ch1
    - syntax is how you write sth
    - **semantics** is what that something means
      + **Type-checking** rules (before program runs) in current static environment
        - what type a binding has
        - produces a type or fail
        -

      + **Evaluating** the bindings (in the dynamic environment)
        - a value or an error or an infinite loop of the preceding bindings
        - look up value in current dynamic environment

    - **idioms** are the common approaches to using langguage features
      + Recursion
      + Let -> local binding

    - libraries
      + standard

    - tools
      + REPL  -> quick try-something-out
      + debugger

    - **immutation data**
      + **it is just a mapping, not assignment statement**, a tuple, or a list
      + No constructs for mutating the data we have build. No way to change the contents of a binding, a tuple,or a list
      + don't worry about the alias or copy like in java
      + or, like java, you have to care whether alias or copy, and in order to avoid the mutable data is been changed

  + sml-ch2
    - tuples are syntactic sugar for records with field names 1, 2, ...

    - type synonyms -> a convenience for talking about types
    - datatypes bindings
      + patter-matching over one-of types
      + better to use pattern-matching to access list and option

    - patter matching over **each-of types**
      + value binding -> a val-binding **can use a pattern**, not just a variable
      + function binding
        - in ML, every function takes **exactly one tuple arg**, implemented with a tuple pattern in the function binding
        - a **function argument** can also be a pattern

      + Type-checker can **figure out the types of things you're matching against**,
      no longer need to write down any explicit types for the arguments to functions or any variables

      + type inference
        - **more general** can replace its type variables consistently

    - nested pattern-matching
      + elegantly recursive

    - **Recursion**
      + **tail-recursive** -> recursive calls are tail-calls
      + call-stacks -> pop the caller before the call, allowing callee to reuse the same stack space

  + sml-ch3
    - first-class functions
    - TODO


#### Python Data Model -> A Framework/API for core language constructs

Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations.

By using and implementing **special methods of Python Data Model** in your objects, your objects can **behave like the built-in types**, enabling the expressive coding style **Pythonic**.

##### Data Sturctures
  * sequences - Python sequences are often categorized as **mutalbe or immutable**, and also could be considered as **flat sequences and container sequences**.
    + container sequences -> hold **references** to the objects
    + flat sequences (like str, bytes) -> more compact because of the physically store the value
    + 
    + **list** -> mutable and mixed-type
      - list comprehensions and generator expression

    + **tuples** -> immutable lists
      - tuples can hold records
      - tuple unpacking -> parallel assignment

    + array -> efficient because of only **the packed bytes for numeric data**
      - for large sequences of numbers, this saves a lot of memory
      - NumPy lib
  
  * dict and set
    + **hash tables** are the engines for the high performance dicts
    + hash tables must be sparse to work, they are **not space efficient**
  
  * str versus bytes

##### Functions as objects
  * Functions, like integers, strings, and dictionaries, also can be a **program entity**, this enables programming in a **functional style**. 
    - The main ideas are that we can assign functions to variables, pass them to other functions, store them in data structures and access function attributes.
    
  * function decorators and closures
  
    
##### Object Oriented


##### Control flow  
  * Generators - declare a function that behaves like an iterator 
    + yield -> return the generator object 
      - yield pauses the function and saves the local state so that it can be resumed right where it left off 
  * Concurrency 


##### Metaprogramming 


#### typescript


#### note  
 * Reload modules problem in Emacs Python Shell
   - use importlib to reload(models) 
   - or use ipython and  %autoreload

 * virtualenvs setup for python3 -> pipenv
   - New a project: >pipenv --python 3.6
   - Install all dependencies:  >pipenv install
   - Locate the virtualenv: >pipenv --venv
   - Use the shell: >pipenv shell
   - Uninstall everything:  >pipenv uninstall --all

 * <del>Your environment contains PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
This doesn't work with Python 3 for obvious reasons. To remove it:  unset PYTHONPATH 
</del>
