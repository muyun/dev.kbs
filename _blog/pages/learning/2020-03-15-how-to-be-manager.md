### 管理方法  - 如何使得所有人都向同一个方向前进  
* 军事化管理法 - 命令和控制式的管理  
    - 要让手下人听话，**人们只做你告诉他们去做的事情**    

    -  造成**微观管理**  
    -  **不是最佳人选在做决策**（负责干活的个人总比“领导”有更多信息）  

    -  人们并不喜欢被这样管  

* 经济利益驱动法 
    - 将 内部激励 变成 外部激励  
        + 内部激励 是**你内心想将事情做好的天然愿望**    
        + 人会为 **他们真正想做的事**  格外努力地工作  
    - 人有 **追求 局部利益最大化**的倾向  

    - 这是在 **鼓励 员工与制度博弈**    

    - 管理退位的信号， 是一种 设计精巧的推卸责任的方法  
        + **不愿承担责任找到办法将事情做得更好**  
        + 表明 **管理层根本不知道如何引导人们做出更好的工作**   
        + 所以 强迫雇员在制度框架下 自己想办法将事情做好  

    - 作为一个经理，**设计一个有效的系统是你的职责**  
        + 这是你拿到高薪的原因  
        + **如何改进工作，有一整套标准的训练程序** 

    -  **管理需要制度，但是你不能放弃自己的职责**
        + 不能通过给员工发钱的方式来训练他们  

* 认同法  - 使得人们认同你希望达到的目标  
    - 设法 **创造出内部激励**  
        + 使得 员工认同公司的目标，这样他们才会感到极大的激励 
        + **你还需要向他们提供必要的信息**，使得他们向正确的方向前进  
    
    - 如果公司目标确实在某种程度上是高尚的，或者**至少在别人看起来是高尚的**
        + 有助于人们产生认同感  

    - **创造一个有 凝聚力的团队**，就好像家庭一样  
        + 这样，就会对同事产生忠诚感和义务感  
        + 比如**大家做在一起吃饭**  
            -  一起干活的人要一起吃饭  
            - 让人们感到公司就像一个大家庭  

    - **向人们提供必要的信息**， 使得公司向正确的方向前进  
        + 让他明白我之所以希望 ..., 完全是因为 ...的动机  
        + 现在他知道这点，很有信心他会做出正确的决定  
        + **通过分享信息，能够使得对方根据外部环境的变化**相应地做出最有利于公司的决定

    -  "This week/month/year **what have I done that was really great**? **From your viewpoint how could I apply that to future projects**?"

    - "**How can I support you (manager) better?  How about the team?**"  
    - "**What are the biggest challenges we face on the team**?  What about as a company?"   
    - "**What do u think are my strengths?  How could I leverage them better to help the organization?**"

    - comes to the meeting **with ideas and solutions on how to addrss your own complaints**

#### treat your manager as **a coach**, not as a judge  

  - 主动向老板**寻求反馈**；主动问问上司，你的哪些工作令他们印象深刻，还有哪些方面需要改进
  -  定期要求与之会面，定期了解他对你的看法
  -  **把重点放在应该完成哪些目标上**， 更好地了解管理层对自己的期望，不仅涉及日常工作，还包括长期思维
    
  - **自己的事情主动跟进，有什么问题就跟老板说，讨论**
      + 如果不是自己管辖范围内的事情，别人开心就好  
      + 这里最重要的是你对你提出的问题已经找到合适的解决方案   


  - It is our job to do the hard and discern the impossible. it then becomes your job to help the entreprenuer find a reasonable solution which is merely hard and gets most of what they wanted. A solution is merely hard when it can be confidently scheduled and the risks are understood.

### how to mange down  

#### Giving Feedback - in a way that was helpful and direct, but also kind and thoughtful  

* **Ask first**  
  - so that the person can be mentally prepared for it ahead of time  
  - "Would you like to hear a suggestion?"  
  - "Do u mind if I give you feedback?"  

  - or start off by asking them "How do u think it went? what do u think was good, what could we improve"  
  

* **compliment + criticism + compliment**  
  -  "The work you ... good; " + "However, ..., it might be better"  

* be timely  
  - feedback is more effective when it is at the time of the event  
  - If too much time has elasped, use judgement  

* Make it about the task, not the person  
  - like **"Adding headers to the email would make it easier to read"**    

* **Give suggestions** on how to improve  
  - tell them how - **give them examples and ideas** on how to make something better  
  - more actionable 

* Provide a personal example  
  - easier to receive is to make the recipient feel like they are not the only one making the mistake  
  - **"I learned this the hard way"** or "**I used to do the same thing**"  

* provide people **the "why"** behind your suggestions  
  
* Allow the person to defend/vent/explain  
  - the receiving party may react by defending or justifying their approach  
  - if that, **just listen and allow them** to say their piece  
  - more ofthen than not they will still make the changes, but **knowing that you heard their side of things will make them feel better**    

* **把事情的前因后果说清楚**， 同时明确告知需要执行的事项

#### Learning to coach and delegate  
  - you are not just be the person who is the expert, you will be **someone who makes everyone better**   

#### The art of **delegating**    
* change your mindset 
  - have to focus on growth and education, not necessarily efficiency. 

* Adopt a **leader:leader model** instead of a leader:follower    
  - Being a good leaders means allowing the people around you to be the experts in their domains   
  - **transform my team to stop asking me questions**, and **instead make recommendations and ask for permission**  
  - **encourage your teammates to take more ownership** and lead their own areas  
  - like "What do you think I would say"  

* Don't look for perfection  
  - open to the differences and you accept that other people may not do things the same way you would  
  - If worried about quality, define your quality up front when you assign the task 

* **Setup some guard rails**    
  - try to **identify what information you need to feel good** about the progress, and then **the best way to
  get the information** without being overbearing or micromanaging the details.  

      + like setup daily status meetings to go voer progress, bi-weekly code reviews to go over implementation, or weekly one-on-ones with other people on the project  

* **Help them come up with a plan**   
  - **have them draft up a plan** and bring it back to you   
  - **Go over their approach together, give them feedback** (like asking good questions)  
  - When **you can draft the idea together**, you will feel more confident in their approach and they will be able to **leverage your expertise and direction**    

* **Lead them to figure it out** 
  - lead them down your steps or your thought process on how you would solve the problem, not just give them the solution  
  - **"what have you tried so far?"**  
  - "What have you considered tyring" 
  - "What did you research? Did you find anything?" 
  - "And then finally, have you tried looking up ..."" (you would look for to find the anser)
  

* **start small**   
  - start with something that is easy to do 
  - find things that maybe aren't urgent but are small, iterative improvements that would be easy introduction into your realm of responsibility

  - 千万不要说自己有做的不对的地方
